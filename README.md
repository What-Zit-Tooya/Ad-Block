# WhatZitTooya's Ad-Block
Personal supplementary filter to block Mobile Ads, Logs & Tracking. You still need 3rd party Ad-Block filter list like AdGuard Base, AdGuard DNS filter, and others to make your Ad-Blocker stronger.

Also there are additional blocklist for Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo (maybe Realme too), Infinix, Samsung and Meizu.

[Ad-Block](https://github.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/raw/main/Main-Blocklist/Ad-Block.txt) | My main ad block. Use it to block mobile ads.
[Ad-Block (Simplified)](https://github.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/raw/main/Main-Blocklist/Ad-Block-Simplified.txt) | Simplified version of my Ad-Block. Suitable for ad-blocking at DNS-level. You can use this as additional DNS filter in AdGuard for Android.
[Ad-Block (HOSTS)](https://github.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/raw/main/Main-Blocklist/Ad-Block-HOSTS.txt) | HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version. Based of my main Ad-Block.

# Usage
My main Ad-Block & Simplified version is suitable for [AdGuard for Android](https://www.anonymz.com/?https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html).

Ad-Block HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version is suitable for [Blokada](https://www.anonymz.com/?https://blokada.org/) and [personalDNSfilter](https://www.anonymz.com/?https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/).

Feel free to improve this filter. I'm new in filterlist of AdBlock. :)
