# Information
To my knowledge, blocking Spotify ads like pain in the a$$ because music server also used by ads server except you play it on web browser.

On web browser, you can block spotify ads server using [uBlock Origin](https://anonym.to/?https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) or [AdGuard Browser Extension](https://anonym.to/?https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) because it can block ads more complex.

Phone ad-blocker like AdGuard usually block whole server address using VPN connection.

# Beware
Spotify will block your account if you are blocking ads. That's why adguard don't block it.
