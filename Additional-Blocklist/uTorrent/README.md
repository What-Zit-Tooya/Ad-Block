# Whats this?
Supplementary filter to block uTorrent ads. Use unmodified uTorrent to use it. Download [uTorrent](https://www.anonymz.com/?https://www.utorrent.com/)

# Disclaimer
This filter pulled from [dnscrypt-proxy](https://www.anonymz.com/?https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) log. Probably not all ads can be blocked because some ads are encrypted. But at least it can decrease ads. And also probably there are false positives.
